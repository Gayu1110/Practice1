 			 Alandi has a long history but gained prominence in the 13th century when Dnyaneshwar (1275–1296) decided to entomb, otherwise known as sanjeevan samadhi, himself in a samadhi, a form of shrine, under the then existing Siddheshwar temple complex in 1296.[4][5] A temple was built over the Samadhi by Ambekar Deshpande in around 1580–1600

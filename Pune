Pune, the seat of the Peshwas has retained its traditional cuisine and a special Pune meal would consist of Puran Poli (a sweet paratha with pulses/dal) Amti (masala dal), 
Pithla Bhakri (a masala chickpea gravy with a stiff ‘roti’), Varan Bhat (dal and rice), Matki Ki Usal (masala sprouts), Thali pith (a spicy chickpea based pancake) and Alu chi Vadi
(steamed and fried, sweet n’ spicy leaves). Bakar Vadi (spicy crusty savoury) and Missal Pav (spicy mixture of onions, chilly and small savoury items, with bread) are some of the most delectable snacks. For those with a sweet tooth, Pune offers its Shrikhand (a burnt milk delicacy) and the seasonal Amras Puri (thick mango juice with fried ‘puris’) complete the traditional Maharashtrian feast.
